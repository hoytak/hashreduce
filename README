To compile or install, run "cmake ." followed by make from the command
line.  The cross-platform cmake program is required to compile the
library; on linux, it is in the common repositories.  Otherwise, see
http://www.cmake.org/.  


To run the suite of unit tests, do the following:

cd tests
python tests.py

There may be several warnings printed; these are okay.  Note that
python is required to run these tests.


To install the library file and headers, run 

make install


If you wish to install them to an alternate location, first run 

cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<dir> ./

then 

make install
