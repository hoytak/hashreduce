I maintain HashReduce as a github_ repository online at
http://github.com/hoytak/hashreduce.  It contains a script to work
with IBD graphs as used in PANGAEA_.  

A source tarball can be downloaded at
http://github.com/hoytak/hashreduce/tarball/master.  Note that this
version requires CMake_ to compile and install.

Issues can be submitted at http://github.com/hoytak/hashreduce/issues.
