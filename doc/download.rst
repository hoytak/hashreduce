I maintain HashReduce as a github_ repository online at
http://github.com/hoytak/hashreduce.  

Note that if you intend to use this library for pedigree analysis, you
might want to use the PANGAEA_ version, IBDgraph_, as it also contains
parsers for reading MORGAN's IBD (identity by descent) graph files.

A source tarball can be downloaded at
http://github.com/hoytak/hashreduce/tarball/master.  Note that this
version requires CMake_ to compile and install.

Issues can be submitted at http://github.com/hoytak/hashreduce/issues.
