There are several coding conventions I use.


Function Naming 
========================================

Functions operating on specific data structures all have a 2 or 3
letter prefix denoting which structure they work with.  The following
abreviations are currently in use:

Hk:  Hash Keys.  Any function that operates on a HashKey, or any child
     structure, begins with Hk.  First argument must point to a
     hash key structure.

Hkf: Hash Key Filling -- functions that fill the hash key fields with
     a hash generated from a specific value.

Ht:  Hash Table.

Hti: Hash Table Iterator.
